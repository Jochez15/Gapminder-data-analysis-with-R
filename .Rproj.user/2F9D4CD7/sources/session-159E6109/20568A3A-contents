Analysis of Gapminder dataset with R.

Aim of project: To explore gaminder dataset and find patterns and relationships between the variables in the dataset. 

1. Find the population overtime for different continents.
2. check the relationship between lifeExp and pop.
3. check the relationship between gdppercap and pop.
4. Evaluate trend of lifeExp growth over a period of time.
5. Evaluate trend in gdp growth ver time
6. Make a visually sophiscated plots for countries(6) with highest life expectancy and countries(6) with lowest life expectancy.

calculating the mean and median life Exp for the different country in the two years.

```{r}
gapminder_21_century_group <- gapminder_21_century %>% group_by(continent, year) %>%  
  summarise(mean(lifeExp), median(lifeExp))

```

we then plot a boxplot to check for outliers.
```{r}
ggplot(gapminder_21_century, aes(x = continent, y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_boxplot() 
```
Asia have outliers which we can decide to filter ou while making inferences. 

Ploting the density graph to check skewness and to determine the best measure of central tendency that represent the data.
```{r}
ggplot(gapminder_21_century, aes(x = gdpPercap, fill = continent)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.3) + scale_x_log10()
```
since most of the continent is skewed which affects the mean, the best measure to use is the median.


Calculating relationship between different combination of the columns.
Ploting a scatter of population vs gdp to determine if gdp is proportional to population
```{r}
ggplot(gapminder_21_century, aes(x = pop, y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_point()
```
We introduce a log scale to enhance interpretability of the scatter
```{r}
ggplot(gapminder_21_century, aes(x = pop, y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_point()  +scale_x_log10()
```
We can conclude there is no real relationship between the population and GdpPercap

Ploting a scatter of population vs lifeExp to determine if lifeExp is proportional to population
```{r}
ggplot(gapminder_21_century, aes(x = pop, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() + scale_x_log10()
```
We can also conclude there is no real relationship between the population and lifeExp

To check if there is a trend in gdp and lifeExp
```{r}
med_lifeExp_group <- gapminder %>% group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(med_LifeExp = median(lifeExp))

ggplot(med_lifeExp_group, aes(x = year, y = med_LifeExp)) + geom_point()+
  expand_limits(y = 0)
```
There is a linear growth in life expectancy of the whole world over the period of time in consideration.
